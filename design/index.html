                <p> Nike used proximity perfectly on their website photo. Everything that is relevent in the photo that the user needs to see is in the middle. You can tell there is a correlation with the person and the sneaker by the distance that is between them. Nike wants you to know that the shoes really prevent injury by smashing the two together.  </p>

                <p>The photo of the oddpears website shows alot of contrast. The sock that showa contrast in itself by having a solid color of black with white polka-dots. In the background they have blue sheet and a pink sheet that perfectly contrast each other. All of these colors and items are on a white background which allows them to pop out.</p>

                <p>The home page for Under Armour shows the perfefct utilization of white space. They could have simply filled in the buttons with a background color, or had a background color for the slogan. They chose not to which allows the user to easily identify what is being promoted on the home page. It also allows the user to clearly see each section of the home page as well.  </p>
